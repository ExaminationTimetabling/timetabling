# timetabling

A timetabling problem is a setting with four parameters:

  - a finite set of time-slots
  - a finite set of resources
  - a finite set of meetings
  - a finite set of constraints
  
The aim is to assign time-slots and resources to the meetings so as
to satisfy the constraints as much as possible.
